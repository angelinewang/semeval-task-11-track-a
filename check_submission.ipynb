    "- **`-s` (Submission file)**: This is the path to the submission file you're trying to check. It should follow the format `pred_<language_code>_<task>.csv` (e.g., `pred_deu_a.csv` for German, track 'a').\n",

    "- **`--evaluate`**: This flag instructs the script to evaluate the submission file by comparing it with the provided gold standard file. It will generate evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score.\n",

    "- **`-g` (Gold data file)**: This is the path to the gold data file, which contains the correct labels. This is necessary for evaluation, and the script will compare your submission to this file to compute the evaluation metrics.\n",

    "### Additional Notes for Participants:\n",
    "- If you are not ready to evaluate your submission or do not have a gold file, you can omit the `--evaluate` and `-g` arguments.\n",
    "- The zipped file will be created if you use the `--zip_for_submission` flag, and it will be ready for upload to the competition platform.\n"

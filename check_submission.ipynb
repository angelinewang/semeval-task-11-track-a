    "- **`--evaluate`**: This flag instructs the script to evaluate the submission file by comparing it with the provided gold standard file. It will generate evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score.\n",

    "### Additional Notes for Participants:\n",
    "- If you are not ready to evaluate your submission or do not have a gold file, you can omit the `--evaluate` and `-g` arguments.\n",
    "- The zipped file will be created if you use the `--zip_for_submission` flag, and it will be ready for upload to the competition platform.\n"
